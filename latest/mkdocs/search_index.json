Paired Differences Index of specificity in quantitative networks.  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.stony     Method .  Stony food web from Thompson   Townsend  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.test_network_property     Method .  Test a network property using randomizations based on a null model, from a pre-existing collection of networks.  Arguments:   N  \u2013 the original network  f  \u2013 the function to test, must return a single floating point value  S  \u2013 an array of randomized networks ( e.g.  the output of  nullmodel )   Keywords:   test  \u2013 the type of test to perform ( :smaller  or  :greater )   source  #  EcologicalNetwork.whittaker     Method .  Whittaker measure of beta-diversity   source  #  EcologicalNetwork.williams     Method .  Williams measure of beta-diversity   source  #  EcologicalNetwork.\u03b7     Method .  Nestedness of a matrix, using the Bastolla et al. (XXXX) measure  Returns three values:   nestedness of the entire matrix  nestedness of the columns  nestedness of the rows   source  #  Base.copy     Method .  Creates a copy of a network \u2013 this returns an object with the same type, and the same content.  source  #  Base.getindex     Method .  Getindex custom to get interaction value from an EcoNetwork  source  #  Base.size     Method .  Return the size of the adjacency matrix of an EcoNetwork object.  source  #  Base.transpose     Method .  Return a transposed network with the correct type  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.best_partition     Method .  Return the best partition  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.delta_matrix     Method .  Get the \u03b4 matrix, representing whether two nodes are part of the same module.  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.draw_matrix     Method .  Low-level function to draw the network  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.most_common_label     Method .  Count most common labels  Arguments are the network, the community partition, and the species id  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.most_common_label     Method .  Count most common labels  Arguments are the network, the community partition, and the species id  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.most_common_label     Method .  Count most common labels  Arguments are the network, the community partition, and the species id  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.motif_internal     Method .  Internal motif calculations  The two arguments are  N  the network and  m  the motif adjacency matrix (as a  DeterministicNetwork ). The two matrices must have the same size.  The function returns a  vectorized  probability of each interaction being in the right state for the motif,  i.e.  P if m is 1, and 1 - P if m is 0.  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.nodf_axis     Method .  NODF of a single axis  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.pdi     Method .  Paired Differences Index for specificity. This function will range the values of each row, so that the strongest link has a value of one.  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.wnodf_axis     Method .  WNODF of a single axis  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.\u03b7_axis     Method .  Nestedness of a single axis (called internally by  \u03b7 )  source  #  EcologicalNetwork.@checkprob     Macro .  Quite crude way of checking that a number is a probability  The two steps are   The number should be of the  Float64  type \u2013 if not, will yield a  TypeError  The number should belong to [0,1] \u2013 if not, will throw a  DomainError   source",
