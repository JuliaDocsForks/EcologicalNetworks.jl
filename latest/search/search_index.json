            "text": "EcologicalNetworks\n\n\nThis package provides a common interface for the analysis of ecological networks, using \njulia\n. It is \nvery\n opinionated about the \"right\" way to do things, but we have documented our opinions in several publications (see the references at the bottom of this page).\n\n\n\n\nPackage philosophy\n\n\nThe package is built around a typesystem for networks, which is intended to capture the different types of data and communities ecologists need to handle. This makes the package extensible, both by writing additional methods with a very fine-tuned dispatch, or by adding additional types that should work out of the box (or be very close to).\n\n\nThis package is a \nlibrary\n for the analysis of ecological networks. On purpose, we do not provide \"wrapper\"-type functions that would perform an entire analysis. We experimented with this idea during development, and rapidly realized that even for the most simple research project, we needed to make small tweaks that made the wrappers a nuisance. We decided to give you lego blocks, and it's your job to build the kick-ass spaceship.\n\n\nWe tried to avoid making the package into yet another Domain Specific Language. This means that when an operation should be expressed using the julian syntax, we made it this way. Transforming networks from a type to another is done with \nconvert\n. Random networks are drawn with \nrand\n. Swapping of interactions is done with \nshuffle\n. There is support for slicing of networks, as well as the entire operations on sets. A lot of methods from \nBase\n have been overloaded, and this \nshould\n make the code easy to write and read.\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I use this package?\n\n\nIt offers a single interface to analyse almost all type of networks for ecology. It's somewhat fast (very specialized packages are likely to be faster). It's built around the very best practices in network analysis. We think the type system is very cool. It's very well tested and adequately documented. We used it for research and teaching for months before releasing it. It's actively maintained and we will keep adding functionalities.\n\n\nYou don't have to use it if you don't want to.\n\n\n\n\nBut it doesn't even make figures!\n\n\nThis is coming soon (in \nEcologicalNetworksPlots\n)\n\n\n\n\nAnd it doesn't even generate random networks!\n\n\nThis is coming sooner (in \nRandomEcologicalNetworks\n).\n\n\n\n\nAnd worse, you forgot my favorite method!\n\n\nYeah, about that. We probably didn't.\n\n\nA lot of methods were considered for inclusion in the package, but ultimately discarded because we were not 100% confident in their robustness, reliability, validity, or interpretation. As we said, the package is \nvery\n opinionated about the right way to do things, and new functions require more time for maintenance and testing; it makes sense for us to focus on things we trust.\n\n\nIf your favorite measure or method is missing, there are two solutions. First, this package is essentialy a library of functions to build network analyses, so you can use this to create a function that does what you want. For example, if you want to take the square root of a quantitative network, you can overload the \n\u221a\n method from base this way:\n\n\nimport Base: \u221a\n\nfunction \u221a(N::T) where {T \n: BipartiteQuantitativeNetwork}\n  # Take the square root of the interaction strength\n  sqrt_matrix = sqrt.(N.A)\n  # Return a new network with the correct types\n  return BipartiteQuantitativeNetwork{eltype(sqrt_matrix),eltype(N)[2]}(sqrt_matrix, EcologicalNetworks.species_objects(N)...)\nend\n\nfunction \u221a(N::T) where {T \n: UnipartiteQuantitativeNetwork}\n  # Take the square root of the interaction strength\n  sqrt_matrix = sqrt.(N.A)\n  # Return a new network with the correct types\n  return UnipartiteQuantitativeNetwork{eltype(sqrt_matrix),eltype(N)[2]}(sqrt_matrix, EcologicalNetworks.species_objects(N)...)\nend\n\n\n\n\nThe second solution (which is actually a second \nstep\n after you have been writing your own method), is to submit a pull request to the package, to have your new methods available in the next release. Currently, we will be very selective about which methods are added (because every line of code needs to be maintained). In the future (presumably shortly after the release of \nJulia\n \nv1.0\n), we will start a companion package to provide additional methods.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAbout the analysis of ecological networks in general, the package covers (or will cover over time) most of the measures we identified as robust in the following publication:\n\n\nDelmas, Eva, Mathilde Besson, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Brice, Laura A.

This is not the most enthralling reading, but this pacge will walk you through the different options, and discuss how and when to use them.\n\n\n\n\nNetwork representation\n\n\nAll networks types have a field \nA\n to store the adjacency matrix, and fields \nS\n, or \nT\n and \nB\n, for species in unipartite and bipartite networks respectively. \nA\n is always a two-dimensional array (see below for more information), where interactions go \nfrom the rows\n, \nto the columns\n. Network types are \nmutable\n. Operations that will modify the network end with a \n!\n, as is the julian convention.\n\n\nFields \nS\n, \nT\n, and \nB\n are one-dimensional arrays of \nAllowedSpeciesTypes\n \u2013 they currently can be \nString\n or \nSymbol\n, and represent the species/nodes names. Future allowed types will be added in later releases.\n\n\nYou should \nnever\n have to manipulate the network by calling its fields directly. The \nspecies\n function will give you access to the species, and the network slicing operations (see later sections) will let you access subset of the network / individual interactions / set of neighbours.\n\n\nNetwork types are currently \nnot iterable\n, but this may be built into a next release.\n\n\n\n\nPartiteness\n\n\nIn unipartite networks, the adjancency matrix \nA\n is square, and has as many rows/columns as there are elements in \nS\n. This is always checked and enforced upon construction of the object, so you \ncannot\n have a mismatch.\n\n\nIn bipartite networks, the matrix \nA\n is not necessarily square, and has dimensions equal to the lengths of \nT\n (rows) and \nB\n (columns). This too is checked upon construction.\n\n\nAll elements in \nS\n \nmust\n be unique (no duplicate node names). In addition, all names in the union of \nT\n and \nB\n must be unique too (so that when a bipartite network is cast to a unipartite one, the constraint on unique names in \nS\n is respected).\n\n\n\n\nType of information\n\n\nAt all points, you can have a look at the types of the interactions and the species objects \u2013 the next entries in this documentation give additional information about the types allowed.\n\n\n#\n\n\nBase.eltype\n \n \nFunction\n.\n\n\neltype(N::T) where T\n:AbstractEcologicalNetwork\n\n\n\n\nReturns a tuple with two types: the type of the interactions, and the type of the species objects.\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nUnion types\n\n\nAll networks are grouped upon the \nAbstractEcologicalNetwork\n type:\n\n\n#\n\n\nEcologicalNetworks.AbstractEcologicalNetwork\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nAll networks in the package belong to the \nAbstractEcologicalNetwork\n type. They all have a field \nA\n to represent interactions as a \nmatrix\n, and a number of fields for species. See the documentation for \nAbstractBipartiteNetwork\n and \nAbstractUnipartiteNetwork\n, as well as \nAllowedSpeciesTypes\n for the allowed types for species.\n\n\nNote that \nall\n species in a network (including both levels of a bipartite network) \nmust\n have the same type. For example, \n[\"a\", :b, \"c\"]\n is not a valid array of species, as not all its elements have the same type.\n\n\nsource\n\n\nAll allowed types for nodes are part of the \nAllowedSpeciesTypes\n type:\n\n\n#\n\n\nEcologicalNetworks.AllowedSpeciesTypes\n \n \nConstant\n.\n\n\nThe \nAllowedSpeciesTypes\n union is used to restrict the type of objects that can be used to identify the species in a network.

The initial temperature has been picked so that after 100 timesteps, using the default \u03bb, a move decreasing modularity by 0.05 (20% of the theoretical maximum) is picked with a probability of 0.1.  Optional arguments regulating the behavior of the simulated annealing routine are:   \u03bb=0.999 , the rate of temperature decay  \u03b8=0.002 , the initial temperature  steps=10_000 , the number of annealing steps to perform  progress=false , whether to display an info message every 100 timesteps   The \u03b8 parameter can be picked using the following method: if we want to allow a maximal loss of modularity of \u03b4, after timestep k, with a decay parameter \u03bb, with a probability P, then \u03b8 = -\u03b4/[\u03bb\u1d4f\u00d7ln(P)]\u207b\u00b9. By beibg more or less restrictive on these parameters, the user can pick a value of \u03b8 for every problem.  This function can work as a first step (like  lp ), but in explorations during the development of the package, we found that  brim  was rarely (if ever) able to optmize the output further. It can therefore be used on its own.  source",
